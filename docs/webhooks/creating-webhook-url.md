# Creating a Webhook URL

To set up a webhook, you will require a webserver that can listen for events at a specific URL, known as the "webhook URL." You will then register this URL with Wiliot during the subscription creation process. To ensure proper functionality, your webhook URL must meet the following criteria:
- Be accessible on the internet
- Have TLS 1.1/1.2 or higher enabled
