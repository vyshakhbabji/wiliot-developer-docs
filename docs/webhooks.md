# How Webhooks Work?

Webhooks are a powerful tool for delivering automated notifications in real-time, serving as a modern alternative to API 
calls. They transmit data from the source to the destination application through HTTP requests or POST 
messages, providing swift and efficient communication. Webhooks offer faster response times than traditional 
API calls, making automation more reliable and efficient.

Webhooks serve as a means of real-time communication between providers and consumers, allowing web 
applications to send messages to other applications or websites when events occur. 
Applications can trigger remote actions when data changes, eliminating the need for repeated checks and saving time. 
Webhooks function similarly to API calls, pushing data to the destination service when events occur on the connected system. 
Developers can set up actions to be triggered through a URL endpoint for seamless, automated responses to specific events.
