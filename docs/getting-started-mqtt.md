# Accessing Event data from Wiliot cloud using MQTT

MQTT provides a quick and easy way to access your Assets' event data from Wiliot cloud. You can register it as an application endpoint/
connection on our platform, Wiliot cloud will start publishing the events to the broker. Now by subscribing to the same topic your application can
access the asset related information from the cloud.


Referred from https://mntolia.com/10-free-public-private-mqtt-brokers-for-testing-prototyping/ article, please find below a list of free to use public
and private MQTT brokers

## Private MQTT Broker 

In a private broker, only devices that you set can publish and subscribe to the topics on the broker. You should use this
for production & prototyping.


## Public MQTT Broker

In a public broker, any device can publish and subscribe to topics on the broker. There is no privacy. Public brokers should
never be used in production. If you simply want to learn or play around with MQTT then use this.


If you want to install your own broker on your computer or virtual machine see this:
