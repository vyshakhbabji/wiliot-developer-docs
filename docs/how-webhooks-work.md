Webhooks are a highly effective mechanism for delivering automated notifications in response to specific events.
They serve as a modern alternative to API calls, offering developers a streamlined way to synchronize internal systems
and applications with external systems in real-time.

Webhooks operate by transmitting data from the source application to the destination application through HTTP requests
or POST messages. This allows for real-time notifications to be sent when any web action is completed, providing swift
and efficient communication between all parties involved. The use of webhooks also offers a
faster response time compared to traditional API calls, making the automation of tasks more reliable and efficient.

Webhooks serve as a means of communication between providers and consumers in real-time, providing the ability
for web applications to send messages to other applications or websites whenever certain events occur. With webhooks,
an application can trigger a remote action when data changes or updates, eliminating the need for repeated checks and
saving time in the process. Webhooks function similarly to API calls, but instead of awaiting a response from the server, they push data to the destination service when events occur on the connected system or website.
Developers can set up corresponding actions to be triggered through a URL endpoint, allowing for a seamless and automated response to specific events.
